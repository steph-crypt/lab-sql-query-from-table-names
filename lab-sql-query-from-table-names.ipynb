The definition for doctors includes a medical degree acknowledgement, but does not use the word \"university\" or \"college\" etc and it does not give examples of leanring institutions. However the model was able to infer from it's training that Harvard is a place where one can procure medical degrees, and therefore it knew to point me to the tables for hospitals and doctors, where the hospital would list which doctors it employs with a degree from Harvard.\n",
